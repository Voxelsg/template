description: AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling
  web applications and services developed with Java,nbsp;.NET, PHP, Node.js, Python,
  Ruby, Go, andnbsp;Dockernbsp;on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger,
  andnbsp;IIS.nYou can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically
  handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling
  to application health monitoring. At the same time, you retain full control over
  the AWS resources powering your application and can access the underlying resources
  at any time.nThere is no additional charge for Elastic Beanstalk - you pay only
  for the AWS resources needed to store and run your applications.
