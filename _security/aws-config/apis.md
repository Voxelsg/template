description: AWS Config is a fully managed service that provides you with an AWS resource
  inventory, configuration history, and configuration change notifications to enable
  security and governance. Config Rules enables you to create rules that automatically
  check the configuration of AWS resources recorded by AWS Config.nWith AWS Config,
  you can discover existing and deleted AWS resources, determine your overall compliance
  against rules, and dive into configuration details of a resource at any point in
  time. These capabilities enable compliance auditing, security analysis, resource
  change tracking, and troubleshooting.
