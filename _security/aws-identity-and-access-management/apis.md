  access to AWS services and resources for your users. Using IAM, you can create and
  manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access
  to AWS resources.nbsp;nIAM is a feature of your AWS account offered at no additional
  charge. You will be charged only for use of other AWS services by your users.nTo
  get started using IAM, ornbsp;if you have already registered with AWS, go to thenbsp;AWS
  Management Consolenbsp;and get started with thesenbsp;IAM Best Practices.
