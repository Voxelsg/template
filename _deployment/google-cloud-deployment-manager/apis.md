description: Google Cloud Deployment Manager allows you to specify all the resources
  needed for your application in a declarative format using yaml. You can also use
  Python or Jinja2 templates to parameterize the configuration and allow reuse of
  common deployment paradigms such as a load balanced, auto-scaled instance group.
  Treat your configuration as code and perform repeatable deployments.
