description: Give your users better location and proximity experiences by providing
  a strong context signal for their devices in the form of Bluetooth low energy (BLE)
  beacons with Eddystone, the open beacon format from Google. The Google beacon platform
  enables you to manage your beacons remotely, integrate with Google services and
  help users devices to discover content and functionality across Android, native
  apps and the web.
